Katie and PJ Hagerty shared their story of venturing into code through KidsRuby.

She gave a talk which she submitted to Nickel City Ruby. Katie showed her first
ever Ruby code which she built using KidsRuby and Turtle graphics. Katie said
she initially started KidsRuby to beat her brother, but she kept on doing it
because she found it fun.

PJ and Katie talked about the different Ruby resources which she's been using to
help her get even more into Ruby.

 - Kids Coder Dojos (A place for kids to come and hack together)
 - [KidsRuby](http://kidsruby.com)
 - [Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com)
 - [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.com)

Having worked through KidsRuby, Katie is now looking to the future.

 - She plans on buildng Kitter, a twitter-like app for kids
 - She's working on an app for WNY CoderDojo
 - She's planning on still being a kid :)

Katie's advice to kids (and adults) thinking about coding was "*Do it*, because
it's FUN!"

Notable quotes from Katie:

  - "You can use puts with 'Hello, World' but it only goes to the screen, so it's more like saying hello to yourself."
  - "Don't put a big sign outside your office saying KIDS! COME CODE! FREE CANDY!"
  - "Coder Dojos are coders who code dojos"
  - "I'm going to change the world with my code"
